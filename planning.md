        . 1) Planning on HTML, CSS, JS
        . 2) Focusing on JS most of the time for programming
        . 3) HTML 
        . 4) Editing the beauty of program with CSS

    + Phase 2 - Refinemnet:
        . 1) Planning on HTML, CSS, JS:

            b) Adding DOCTYPE in HTML
            c) link CSS and JS to HTML
        . 2) Planning JS most of the time for programming
            a) Create an array
            b) Use Math.floor and Math.random to create new element and assign to array
            c) Use control flow to keep the game going
            d) Each new round with start at array[0] to array[i]
            e) Use condition to player to keep the going or not
            f) Add sound
        . 3) HTML
            a) Creating IDs and classes
            b) Using DOM and event Listener in JS to interact with player
        . 4) Editing the beauty of program with CSS
            a) Design color of the options
            b) Add background color

            b) Creating DOCTYPE in HTML
            c) Link CSS, JS to HTML
        . 2) Planning JS most of the time for programming
            a) Create an an array to store new elements each round. Start at 0 elements when creating
            b) Use Math.floor and Math.random to create random of 4 options
            c) Assign it to array
            d) Use while loop to keep the going if player enter correctly
            e) Use for loop to display the number of options that player needs to enter
            f) Using if conditions to check whether the player answers correctly or not
            g) If yes, keep the condition true in while so as to keep the game going. Otherwise, stop the game and display message
        . 3) HTML
            a) Add IDS and classes
            b) Adding DOM and event listener in JS
            c) When the player click, store it into another array
            d) Display music whenever player click
            e) Display music when the number of options need to be clicked
            f) Display current score (the level that the player is currently in)
            g) Adding classes to options
        . 4) Editing the beauty of program with CSS
