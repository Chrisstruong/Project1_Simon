# General Assembly Project1: SIMON (traffic light version):
I am so happy to show my accomplishment at General Assembly (GA) in the first three weeks: Simon game. I got inspired the idea of design from traffic light in GA pre-work. I will be honored if you can take time to try out: https://chrisstruong.github.io/Project1_Simon/

MY STRETCH GOAL

1) Add mode level (easy, medium, hard).
2) Add sounds when color blinking.

Simon is game that you have to click colors in order so as to win. There are four colors in my game. Every single round, simon will repeat the order and create one random color added to the order. The game is over when you click a wrong color in order.
